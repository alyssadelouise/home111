In March 2020 we were sent home from our schools due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Morale was low and many students, especially those from diverse communities, felt feelings of cluelessness, imposter syndrome, and questioning if STEM was right for them amongst this new normal. I had many doubts throughout my time in high school and starting collegem so I wanted to share my experinces.

## Reinvented Magazine Gave Me That Chance

I had such an amazing time working with Reinvented. They loved my idea of sharing my journey as a young, first-gen woman in STEM who was finding her way and learned a lot in the process. I wanted to share as much as I could about myself and what I learned to hopefully inspire or help another young student feel good about their path. While I did mention my hardships, these were gems of experiences in my growth as a person, engineer, and leader. At the end of the day- regardless of any doubts- I do all that I do <b> Beacuse I Belong Here </b> and so do my amazing peers! :)
