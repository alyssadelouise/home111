During the Spring semester of 2021, I embarked on a new journey of research with Dr. Lindsay Weinberg of the Purdue Honors College. I am researching Power Structures in Digital Technologies. This means I am looking closely at the social, political, economic, etc., structures that exist in our innovation based society and how they affect how we use, implement, and teach digital technologies. My focus is in Gender Bias in AI where I am looking at both the workplace and work products that contain innate biases that affect the AI industry. Ethics and diversity are my passion areas within tech as I feel all groups deserve their place at the table, but they have not been given the proper resources or education to get to that point.

## Why does this matter?
Technology and innovation culture is here to stay. More specifically, the workplace will continue to implement more and more technology as we go, finding more feasbile mechanisms to bring in tech for convenience and to reach new levels. Emerging technologies will also continue to push boundaries as they are setting the precedent for the future tech. Power Structures in Digital Technologies are important to understand as we push progress in tech because these structures drive the creation and future of the technologies. The innate bias they create lives eternally in the technology. If we go too far as an innovation society without considering the ethics of the tech we create, it may be too late to reverse any bias that ultimately disadvantages one group or another. Gender Bias in AI is both an HR and Development issue- two sides of the same coin- and is particularly an issue as AI implementation and culture is part of a large growth and the moment and will continue to grow to new heights we cannot even predict yet. During this growth it is so important for engineers, analysts, business decision makers, and the entirety of entities to consider the ethics of their creations- especially those like AI with such great potential and global effects we cannot predict yet.


## What's next?
Well, I started my research during the Spring semester of 2021, so I am using the Summer of 2021 (present day) to continue my research, specifically looking into and speaking with the up and coming industry leaders that use or plan to use AI. I have many questions regarding the gender gap in tech leadership, team building in AI, ethics considerations, and so many more. I plan to use this time to also explore academia and get my hands on as much data as possible. This is a very exciting time for both me and the industry, and my goal is to take this research to not only express my passion but create a learning moment for the future of STEM.
