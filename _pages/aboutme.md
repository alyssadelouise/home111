Hiya there, my name is Alyssa DeLouise. I am an aspiring innovator in tech with a passion for STEM adovocacy and outreach. As a first-gen, woman in STEM I have found myself struggling with the college process, financial stability, and confidence in achieving my dreams. Today, I use my imposter syndrome as motivation to continue to battle the hurdles of my success and come out victorious. I am so fortunate to be able to use my platforms to share my story, offer insight on my experiences, give advice, and hopefully empower the next generation of powerful women and diversity in STEM.

I am interested in roles in many different places. I, one day, envision myself as a CEO. On my journey to leadership, I would like to explore the energy and power industry. I also enjoy myself and see future potential in product managment roles. I aim to build from diverse thought and imagination to create the tech of the future. By destroying barriers between engineers and their visionary counterparts, I plan to lead the next wave of innovation. 

Thank you for being a part of my journey! I am beyond excited to share all that I accomplish in the next few years and beyond.

## Purdue University
<small>2019 - Present</small>

I am a <strong>rising sophomore at Purdue University</strong> pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In addition, I am getting a certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation as well as a minor in Law and Society. Some of my most notable <strong>achievements and honors</strong> are being recognized as a... Purdue Presidential scholar, AnitaB.org Grace Hopper Celebration Scholar '20, Chevron STEM Ambassador '20, SWE 2020 Intel Scholarship recipient, Rewriting the Code Fellow '21,  and participant in the BP STEP (Shaping Talent, Energy, & Potential) Leadership Program in July 2020. 

<strong>On campus</strong>, I am involved in professional organizations like the Society of Women Engineers chapter and their outreach committe, the Women in Engineering Program and mentorship components, and the engineering student body. I volunteer for events in outreach to educate potential new students, specifically girls, about Purdue and their opportunities. For fun, I play on the Spikeball team and choreograph for the Higher Ground Dance Co. where all proceeds from shows are donated to the Andrea Rizzo foundation. I am also an active member of Phi Sigma Rho sorority, a Greek organization for women in engineering and select STEM fields. As the current Spirit Director, I organize sisterhood activities to boost overall morale and enthusiasm surrounding the house. In the past, I was my candidate class public relations coordinator where I facilitated outreach into the Greek community. 

In my <strong>free time</strong>, I am an ambassador for the Female Laboratory of Innovative Knowledge. In FLIK, I am an apprentice where I gain various skills and experience in startups. I am also a mentor and alumna of Girls Who Code. I volunteer at The Empowerment Hub, where I tutor young students remotely who have been affected by COVID-19.

<strong>Professionally</strong>, I have been gaining amazing experience! During summer of 2020, I was fortunate to join Edify, a engineering onboarding startup, remotely as an operations intern and an apprentice in product and engineering. During my operations internship, I developed research to measure success of software, applied original UX research to operations, product, and marketing initiatives in collaboration with the CEO and Product Director. For my product and engineering apprenticeship, I conducted user and UI/UX research implementing video game strategy to further develop the product roadmap. I also conducted research on technical documentation and laid out the plan to implement various forms of technical documentation into the business in both the backend and customer facing aspects!
