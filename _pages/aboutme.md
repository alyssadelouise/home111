Hiya there, my name is Alyssa DeLouise. I am an aspiring innovator in tech with a passion for STEM adovocacy and outreach. As a first-gen, woman in STEM I have found myself struggling with the college process, financial stability, and confidence in achieving my dreams. Today, I use my imposter syndrome as motivation to continue to battle the hurdles of my success and come out victorious. I am so fortunate to be able to use my platforms to share my story, offer insight on my experiences, give advice, and hopefully empower the next generation of powerful women and diversity in STEM.

I am interested in roles in many different places. I, one day, envision myself as a CEO. On my journey to leadership, I would like to explore the energy and power industry. I also enjoy myself and see future potential in product managment roles. I aim to build from diverse thought and imagination to create the tech of the future. By destroying barriers between engineers and their visionary counterparts, I plan to lead the next wave of innovation. 

Thank you for being a part of my journey! I am beyond excited to share all that I accomplish in the next few years and beyond.

## Purdue University
<small>2019 - Present</small>

I am a <strong>rising junior at Purdue University</strong> pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In addition, I am getting a certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Some of my most notable <strong>achievements and honors</strong> are being recognized as a... Purdue Presidential scholar, AnitaB.org Grace Hopper Celebration Scholar '20, Chevron STEM Ambassador '20, SWE 2020 Intel Scholarship recipient, participant in the BP STEP (Shaping Talent, Energy, & Potential) Leadership Program in July 2020, Rewriting the Code Fellow '21, SWE 2021 Keysight Scholarship recipient, Lockheed Martin STEM Scholarship recipient '21, Purdue Honors College Leadership Development Pillar Award Winner '21, and participant in the Deloitte National Leadership Conference in June 2021. 

<strong>On campus</strong>, I am involved in professional organizations like the Society of Women Engineers chapter and their outreach committee, the Women in Engineering Program and mentorship components, and the engineering student body. I am also the collegiate mentor for the SWE chapter at my High School back home. I volunteer for events in outreach to educate potential new students, specifically girls, about Purdue and their opportunities. For fun, I play on the Spikeball team and choreograph for the Higher Ground Dance Co. where all proceeds from shows are donated to the Andrea Rizzo foundation. I am also an active member of Phi Sigma Rho sorority, a Greek organization for women in engineering and select STEM fields and have served as my candidate class PR coordinator and chapter Spirit Director. I am also a member of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society and Ambassadors program where I facilitate outreach events, advise D&I efforts, help build and design the website, and manage the social media accounts. 

In my <strong>free time</strong>, I am an ambassador for the Female Laboratory of Innovative Knowledge. In FLIK, I am an apprentice where I gain various skills and experience in startups. I also lead workshops and facilitate dicsussions around diversity, inclusion, advocacy, and ethics in STEM. I believe it is so important to challenge present day notions and start uncomfortable conversations for the future of innovation. I am also a mentor and alumna of Girls Who Code. 

<strong>Professionally</strong>, I have been gaining amazing experience! During Summer 2020, I was fortunate to join Edify, a engineering onboarding startup, remotely as an Operations Intern and an Apprentice in Product and Engineering. During Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I was invited to stay and grow with Edify as a Product Management Intern. During my time at Edify, I particpated in the growth within the engineering onboarding and AI industry, actively contributing to a breadth of operations from product to back end to customer support to UI/UX within the company as iterations were carried about from beta testing to full product launch! During Summer 2021 (right now!), I am a Digital Science Intern at bp working on digital ethics and robotic simulation. I am also a math instructor at Juni Learning, where I instruct students of various ages and learning styles remotely, enriching their abilities in Math and reasoning.

### Current/Future Goals

* Meet with one professional a week to have a coffee chat
* Take a finance class
* Host another webinar series and reach even more young, STEM students!
* Share my research with the industry
